In these under ways they lived and died, rarely ascending to the surface except when work took them there. Since for most of them this was the sort of life to which they had been born, they found no great misery in such circumstances; but for people like Denton and Elizabeth, such a plunge would have seemed more terrible than death.</p><p>"And yet what else is there?" asked Elizabeth.</p><p>Denton professed not to know.
