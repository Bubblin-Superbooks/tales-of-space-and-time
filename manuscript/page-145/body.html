Then she sprang to her feet and scrambled a yard or so up the cliff above the ledge. How she hung on even for a moment I do not know, for the chalk was vertical and without grip for a monkey. In a couple of seconds she had slid back to the ledge again with bleeding hands.</p><p>Ugh-lomi was making frantic rushes about the ledge&mdash;now he would go to the edge, now to the gully. He did not know what to do, he could not think. The she-bear looked smaller than her mate&mdash;much. If they rushed down on her together, one might live. "Ugh?" said the cave bear, and Ugh-lomi turned again and saw his little eyes peering under the bulge of the chalk.</p></div> </div>
