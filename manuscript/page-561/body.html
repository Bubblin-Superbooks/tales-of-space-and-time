<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"When the Sleeper Wakes," by far the longest story Mr. Wells has yet given us, presents a spacious picture of the development of our civilisation during the next two hundred years. The sleeper is a typical liberal-minded man of means of the nineteenth century, and he awakens from a cataleptic trance in the year 2100, to discover that by an ironic combination of circumstances he has become the central figure of an enormous political convulsion.
