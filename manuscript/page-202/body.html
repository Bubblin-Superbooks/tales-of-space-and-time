<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Ugh-lomi through the hawthorn thickets where Yaaa the Rhinoceros and his brothers were feeding, and up the bare downland towards the beechwoods.</p><p>That night the fires burnt high and fierce, as the waxing moon set, and the lion left the crouching women and children in peace.</p><p>And the next day, while the sun was still high, the hunters returned&mdash;all save One Eye, who lay dead with a smashed skull at the foot of the ledge. (When Ugh-lomi came back that evening from stalking the horses, he found the vultures already busy over him.) And with them the hunters brought Eudena bruised and wounded, but alive. That had been the strange order of the shrivelled old woman, that she was to be brought alive&mdash;"She is no kill for us. She is for Uya the Lion." Her hands were tied with thongs, as though she had been a man, and she came weary and drooping&mdash;her hair over her eyes and matted with blood.</p></div> </div>
