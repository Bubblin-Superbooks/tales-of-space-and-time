Eudena lay like a hare in its form, with shining eyes fixed on the bent witch away there, and presently she dimly understood it was the lion the old woman was worshipping&mdash;the lion Ugh-lomi had slain.</p><p>And the next day the hunters came back weary, carrying a fawn, and Eudena watched the feast enviously.
