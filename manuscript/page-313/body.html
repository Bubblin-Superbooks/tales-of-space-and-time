They had been separated and reunited, and still they could not marry. For Denton&mdash;it was his only fault&mdash;had no money. Neither had Elizabeth until she was twenty-one, and as yet she was only eighteen. At twenty-one all the property of her mother would come to her, for that was the custom of the time.
