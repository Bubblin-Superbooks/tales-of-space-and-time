<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The night suddenly seemed full of movement. She held her breath. Things were passing&mdash;one, two, three&mdash;subtly sneaking shadows.... Jackals.</p><p>Then a long waiting again.</p><p>Then, asserting itself as real at once over all the sounds her mind had imagined, came a stir in the thicket, then a vigorous movement. There was a snap. The reeds crashed heavily, once, twice, thrice, and then everything was still save a measured swishing. She heard a low tremulous growl, and then everything was still again. The stillness lengthened&mdash;would it never end? She held her breath; she bit her lips to stop screaming. Then something scuttled through the undergrowth. Her scream was involuntary. She did not hear the answering yell from the mound.</p></div> </div>
