He sat on the canvas pallet expounding this new aspect to Elizabeth. One side of his face was bruised. She had not recently fought, she had not been patted on the back, there were no hot bruises upon her face, only a pallor and a new line or so about the mouth. She was taking the woman's share. She looked steadfastly at Denton in his new mood of prophecy. "I feel that there is something," he was saying, "something that goes on, a Being of Life in which we live and move and have our being, something that began fifty&mdash;a hundred million years ago, perhaps, that goes on&mdash;on: growing, spreading, to things beyond us&mdash;things that will justify us all.... That will explain and justify my fighting&mdash;these bruises, and all the pain of it. It's the chisel&mdash;yes, the chisel of the Maker.</p></div> </div>
